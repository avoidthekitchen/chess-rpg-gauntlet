# Region 1 build progress

Following "First implementation: Region 1" in `docs/design.md`. One entry per build step.

## Step 1: Phaser game with the battle screen ported

**Done**
- Phaser 4.2.1 game (`src/main.ts`, `src/scenes/`). Canvas is sized in device pixels and every camera zooms by the pixel ratio, so scenes lay out in CSS pixels and text and tokens stay sharp on phones (`src/ui/screen.ts`). Screens rebuild from state on resize.
- Battle scene (`src/scenes/Battle.ts`) runs the prototype's `Battle` rules, Stockfish enemy, Threat Sight, rewind, tactic banners and promotion choice, unchanged in `src/game` and `src/ai`.
- Board (`src/ui/phaserBoard.ts`) is a port of the PixiJS board: tokens, knight hop with the dotted L, rook stomp, glide, capture freeze frame + white flash + shake + knock-out, dust and sparks, hanging-piece and check glows, drop-in intro, rewind shimmer. Same timings and easing.
- Talking-head portraits are drawn in Phaser (`src/ui/portrait.ts`): a card above the panel on desktop, a card floating at the bottom for 4 seconds on phones. `src/ui/speaker.ts` keeps the lines, now per faction (Bandit and Bog lines) and with named characters.
- Classic pieces toggle ("Pieces" button) swaps tokens for standard chess glyphs, remembered between sessions.
- Long text (lessons, results, promotion choice) uses an HTML overlay on top of the canvas (`src/ui/overlay.ts`), as the tech stack table says.
- Phone layout: board full width with ~45 px squares on a 390 px phone (the frame was slimmed slightly from the prototype to get there; 43.6 px on a 375 px phone).

**Simplified or skipped**
- The old PixiJS board, DOM board and prototype CSS were removed (`pixi.js` dependency dropped); they're in git history. The 3D mockups are untouched and still use `gsap` and `three`.
- Step 1 uses a plain battle list in place of the region map; the map comes in step 2.
- The classic toggle keeps the same tilted wooden board and only swaps the pieces.

**Worth a look**
- Phone squares: 43.6 px at 375 px wide, 45 px at 390 px. Desktop squares are capped at 80 px.
- Dev testing tip: `?loop=timeout` keeps the game loop running in a hidden browser tab (dev builds only).
